ABOUT THIS PACKAGE:
===============================================
This package contains R scripts and function to run MethCoresProfiler analysis.

Three executable scripts are provided with this version of MethCoresProfiler:

  - 1_MethCores_Extractor.R:
    -> requires three types of input files: i. a tab delimited text file of EpiHaplotypes in BINARY format; ii. a tab delimited 
       text file containing information on the CpGs position in the sequence (or string), and; iii. a tab delimited text file 
       containing metadata (information) associated with each sample with the following columns: #SampleID, Tissue, Description, 
       Group, Rep, ID. The first two files can be generated by available tools. Generates several tables reporting: i, All CpG 
       methylation profiles (frequency of single mCpG); ii, The tetrachoric correlations of CpGs; iii, The co-occurrence of two 
       mCpGs; iv, The taxonomic distribution of methylated species; v, The Shannon-Entropy index and the summary/sample, statistics 
       and plots.
  - 2_MethCores_Combinator.R:
    -> takes as input a list of regions, all significant 2-mCpGs combinations annotated by MethCores_Extractor.R and
       a series of filtering parameters. The frequency of all mCpGs combinations (3 mCpGs or more) will be compared 
       to the expected frequency for independent events (x-square for independence statistics, p value â‰¤ 10-9) and 
       will be annotated; iii. The epialleles containing all significant mCpGs combinations will be extracted; iv. 
       The structure and frequency of significant mCpGs combinations (cores) and individual epialleles will be reported 
       (ComposCore and Tab_Epialleles, respectively). In the absence of significant mCpGs combinations, all epialleles 
       will be brought to the next step
  - 3_MethCores_Analysis.R:
    -> takes as input epialleles annotated by MethCores_Combinator.R, a list of regions and a series of filtering parameters. 
       Generates generating heatmaps of their structure and frequency. In this step, the frequency of each epiallele in the 
       sample is compared (x-square test) to a random control (R), generated automatically by Module 1, with the same number 
       of CpGs and depth (theoretical distribution). Individual significant epialleles are marked in a complex heatmap format 
       (red = high frequency, blue = low frequency and white = neutral). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of significant 
       epialleles is also performed in this step. Finally, for each sample, the MethCores Analyst extracts the most frequent 
       mCpGs shared by significant epialleles using a decreasing percentage scale (frequency of CpGs in only significant epialleles) 
       starting from 0.9 (minimum 2-mCpGs). If significant epialleles were not found at this stage, the epiallele with the highest 
       frequency will be annotated and its structure will be considered as a stable signature or core.
       The MethCores_Analyst generates three types of indices: i. MethCores Index i.e., the frequency of the methylated cores in 
       the population; ii. Clonality Index, i.e., the frequency of methylated cores normalized to the average methylation in the 
       population; iii. in-phase CpGs Index or Stability Index or Entanglement Index, or E, which measures the rate of coupling or 
       association of at least 2 mCpGs (mCpG1 and mCpG2) in the core
